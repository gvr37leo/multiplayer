trying to make a multiplayer game with nodejs

# installation
1. install node https://nodejs.org/
2. put the files in a folder and go to that folder using the command line
3. use the node package manager that comes with node to install express and socket.io. You do this by typing in the command prompt "npm install express" and "npm install socket.io"
4. run the server by typing "node server.js"
5. type in your browser "localhost:8000" and if you portforward this give people "your ip:8000"
